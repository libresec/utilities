This script can be used to display how long it takes to produce a password 
hash using bcrypt. The built-in benchmark module is used for timing.

Tested using: 
	ruby 1.9.3p194
	bcrypt-ruby (3.0.1)

Usage: ruby BCrypt_test.rb 12

This will generally output ~.25 seconds, but it's hardware-dependent.
